- üè• Healthcare-focused Responses
- üñ•Ô∏è Interactive Streamlit Interface

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended for optimal performance)
- Anaconda or Miniconda

## Installation

1. **Install Anaconda/Miniconda**

   Download and install Anaconda or Miniconda from:

   - Anaconda: [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)
   - Miniconda: [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

2. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mediassist.git
   cd mediassist
   ```

3. **Create and Activate Conda Environment**

   ```bash
   conda env create --name mediassist -f environment.yml
   ```

4. **Install Ollama**

   Follow the installation instructions for your operating system:

   - For Windows: Use WSL2 to install Ollama

5. **Download Required Models**
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2:1b
   ollama pull nomic-embed-text
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Prepare Knowledge Base**

   - Place your medical knowledge base PDF in the project root directory
   - Update the PDF path in `AIVoiceAssistant.py` if needed:
     ```python
     pdf_path="./your_knowledge_base.pdf"
     ```

2. **Audio Setup**
   - Ensure your microphone is properly connected and configured
